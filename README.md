  - Predictability: Easier to predict project timeline and deliverables.
- Disadvantages:
  - Inflexibility: Hard to accommodate changes once a phase is completed.
  - Delayed Testing: Testing occurs after implementation, leading to late detection of issues.

4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile:
- Beneficial For: Projects with evolving requirements, high uncertainty, or need for rapid iteration and feedback.
- Examples:
  - Software Development: Developing a new app where features and requirements may change based on user feedback.
  - Startups: Building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) where speed and adaptability are critical.
Waterfall:
- Beneficial For: Projects with well-defined requirements, low uncertainty, and where a linear process is feasible.
- Examples:
  - Construction Projects: Building a bridge with precise specifications and sequential phases.
  - Manufacturing: Production of a product with established design and processes.
 Agile suits dynamic projects needing flexibility, while Waterfall fits structured projects with clear, unchanging requirements.

5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Quality Assurance Methods:
- Automated Testing: Use tools to run tests automatically.
- Code Reviews: Regular peer reviews to catch issues early.
- Continuous Integration: Integrate and test code frequently.
- User Testing: Gather feedback from end-users.
- Documentation: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation.
Importance of High Standards:
- Reliability: Ensures the software functions correctly and consistently.
- User Satisfaction: Delivers a positive experience, meeting user expectations.
- Maintainability: Easier to update and fix issues.
- Reputation: Builds trust and credibility with users and stakeholders.
By employing these methods, software projects can maintain high quality and deliver successful results.

6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining Project Scope:
- Clarity: Clearly defines deliverables and objectives.
- Focus: Keeps the team aligned with project goals.
- Resource Allocation: Ensures efficient use of resources and time.
- Risk Management: Identifies potential risks early on.
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
